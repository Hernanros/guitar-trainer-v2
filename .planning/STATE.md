# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-15)

**Core value:** One real song, decomposed by an AI teacher, every day — so practicing feels like playing.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — AI Teacher & Song of the Day

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (Cost Governor & Node Verification) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 2 of 4 (Slice A complete — executing Slice B next)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-07-30 -- 04-01 governor + breakdown cap shipped (3 commits: ece7957, d739330, 614c081)

Progress: [████████████░░] Phase 1 iOS ✓, Phase 2 iOS ✓, Phase 3 ✓, Phase 4 in progress

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Design phase (2026-07-14, recovered): Mobile-first Expo + RN, music-centric (not exercise-centric), MVP is "Prove the loop" — self-report only, no mic
- Design phase (2026-07-14, recovered): 4-layer AI cost guardrails, $20/month POC cap, single-module server-side governor
- Design phase (2026-07-14, recovered): Skill graph is a 3-level DAG with 5-bpm tempo bins, deterministic writes only, nightly 5% decay >7 days
- Roadmap (2026-07-15): 5 vertical-MVP phases, each delivering an end-to-end user capability; every phase carries `Mode: mvp`
- Phase 1 context (2026-07-15): Full Phase 3-ready payload shape from day one (dummy content), Pydantic → OpenAPI → generated TS types, semantic music JSON for tab/chords, DB-backed trivial selector at `GET /api/v1/song-of-day`
- Fletcher product identity (2026-07-19): Product named Fletcher (JK Simmons / Whiplash reference); "the teacher Fletcher should have been" positioning — reinforcing not critical, celebrates hard-won achievements by grinders (not savants). Fletcher-vocabulary ("Rushing", "Dragging", "Not my tempo") used as diagnosis + coaching (sharp word + next step). Design brief at `.planning/design/fletcher-identity.md`.
- Phase 2 context (2026-07-20): 5-section wizard (Welcome/Play/Working/Aspire/Preferences), MMKV wizard state + device UUID identity (resolves multi-user seams — users table + X-User-ID header, no auth), free-text + Sonnet batch parse on Complete (~$0.02–$0.05/user), fixed root taxonomy, normalized per-user tree schema, all mastery starts at 0 (deterministic writes principle preserved)
- Phase 4 Slice A (2026-07-30): Cap counts ALL views (cache-hit and cache-miss) against 3/7d limit — cap-check runs before cache read in breakdowns endpoint; record governor_calls row even for cache hits so the rolling window is accurate
- Phase 4 Slice A (2026-07-30): ContextVar approach for call_id passthrough — single-worker (uvicorn --workers 1) means each async task inherits its own ContextVar copy at creation time, no cross-task leakage; simpler than explicit kwarg threading
- Phase 4 Slice A (2026-07-30): record_estimate / record_actuals open a fresh AsyncSessionLocal() session — avoids cross-session state with the endpoint's session; isolated UPDATE commits are safe under single-worker posture
